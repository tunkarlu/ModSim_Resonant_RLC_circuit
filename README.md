Experiment Resonant RLC Circuit

***This project is part of AVE3 pratical course for Modelling and Simulation.
The experiment is to study about the electro-magnetic oscillationss by electric resonant circuit.
RLC circuit consists of two energy storing elements (capacitor and inductor) contributing to continuous exchange of energy which causes the oscillation behaviour.
The system response is generated by external excitation with different frequencies and signal shapes.
This system shows PT-2 behaviour which is investigated in pratical and in matlab simulink and the results are validated.
